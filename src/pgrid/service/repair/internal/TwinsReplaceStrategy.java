/**
 * <h1>The implementation of the Thesis replace algorithm.</h1>
 * <p/>
 * If the failed host is the conjugate of the localhost, then it will reduce
 * its path to the common prefix of both.
 * <br/>
 * <b><i>Example:</i></b> If the failed host is on "1" and the localhost on
 * "0", then simply the localhost will move to path "". That is, it will hold
 * the whole keyspace. The example is analogous to longer paths.
 * <p/>
 * If the conjugate has nothing to do with the failed host, then the host with
 * path ending with '1' will take the path of the failed and the host with path
 * ending with '0' will reduce it path by one.
 * <br/>
 * <b><i>Example:</i></b> If the failed host is on "1" and the localhost is on
 * "00" and its conjugate on "01", then the new path of the localhost will be
 * "0" and that of its conjugate will be "1". The example is analogous to
 * longer paths.
