P-Grid is a self-organizing structured peer-to-peer system, which can
accommodate arbitrary key distributions, still providing storage load-balancing
and efficient search by using randomized routing. This project is an
implementation of the peer-to-peer infrastructure of P-Grid. The main goal is
to add a fault-tolerant protocol. The implementation is based on SOA
principles.
This project is part of my dissertation.
