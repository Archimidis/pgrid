This project is an\r\nimplementation of the peer-to-peer infrastructure of P-Grid. The main goal is\r\nto add a fault-tolerant protocol. The implementation is based on SOA\r\nprinciples.\r\nThis project is part of my dissertation.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### Libraries in use\r\n* [Google guice 3.0](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/)\r\n* [logback 1.0](http://logback.qos.ch/)\r\n* [slf4j 1.6.4](http://www.slf4j.org/)\r\n\r\n### Compilation\r\nRun the following commands to produce all the needed corba interfaces and\r\nclasses before compilation.\r\n1. cd pgrid\r\n2. idlj -fall -td src/ resources/pgrid_corba.idl\r\n\r\nFinally run the ant script.\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed under the GPL version 3 license, quoted below.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nCopyright 20011-2013 Nikolas Vourlakis\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify \r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by \r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or \r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, \r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of \r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
